# Intro-to-Data-Science-Final
In this project, I chose to work on analyzing stock market crashes.

My inspriation for this project was the stock market boom we were experiencing during 2020...
I was skeptical of the all-time highs we were seeing and decided to compare recent Price to Earnings ratios (P/E) to
the ratios during major crashes.
